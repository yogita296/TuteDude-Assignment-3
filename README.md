# TuteDude-Assignment-3
This repository contains my submission for the Python course assignment from Tutedude. It includes two Python scripts that solve the given problems.

## Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function

This Python program:
- Takes a number as input from the user
- Defines a recursive function to calculate the factorial of the number
- Returns and displays the calculated factorial

## Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations

This Python program:
- Takes a number as input from the user
- Uses the `math` module to calculate:
  - The square root of the number
  - The natural logarithm (log base e) of the number
  - The sine of the number in radians
- Displays the calculated results


## ðŸ’» How to Run the Programs (Using PyCharm)
